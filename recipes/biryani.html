    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <img src="Biryani.jpg" height="200px" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent and is beloved worldwide. To prepare biryani, start by marinating your choice of meat—commonly chicken, lamb, or beef—with yogurt, garlic, ginger, and a mix of spices like turmeric, garam masala, and chili powder. Let the meat marinate for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld. Meanwhile, prepare the basmati rice by parboiling it in water infused with whole spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves. Once the rice is partially cooked, layer it with the marinated meat in a heavy-bottomed pot, alternating between rice and meat layers.</p>
    <p>Top the dish with fried onions, fresh herbs like cilantro and mint, and a drizzle of saffron milk or food coloring to give the biryani its signature yellow hue. Seal the pot with dough or foil and cook on low heat (also known as the dum method) to allow the steam to finish cooking the dish, infusing all the layers with flavor. Serve the biryani hot with a side of cooling raita, a yogurt-based accompaniment, and enjoy the explosion of spices, tender meat, and fragrant rice in every bite.</p>

        <li>4-5 whole cloves</li>
        <li>2-3 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>3-4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4-5 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
      
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced and fried until golden brown (for garnishing)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron strands soaked in warm milk (or yellow/orange food coloring)</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons of ghee or oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of milk (for soaking saffron)</li>
      
        <li>Optional: 1/4 cup of raisins</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/4 cup of cashew nuts</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 tablespoon of rose water (for added fragrance)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Marinate the meat with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, garam masala, red chili powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, lemon juice, and salt. Let it marinate for at least an hour or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, green cardamom pods, and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until the rice is 70-80% done (parboiled). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the marinated meat and cook until the meat is browned and partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Begin layering the partially cooked meat and rice. Start with a layer of meat at the bottom, followed by a layer of rice. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
        <li>Top the layered rice with fried onions, chopped cilantro, chopped mint, and saffron-soaked milk (or food coloring). You can also sprinkle rose water if using.</li>
        <li>Seal the pot tightly with a lid or cover it with aluminum foil, ensuring no steam escapes. Cook the biryani on low heat (dum method) for 25-30 minutes, allowing the steam to cook the rice and meat completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, gently fluff the rice and meat layers together with a fork, being careful not to break the rice grains.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and enjoy your homemade biryani!</li>
